A poet  named Shi  lived in a stone house  and liked to eat  lion flesh,  and he
vowed to eat  ten of them.  He used to go to the market in search of lions,  and
one day, at ten o'clock,  he chanced to see  ten of them there.  Shi  killed the
lions  with arrows  and picked up their bodies,  carrying them back to his stone
house.  His house  was dripping  with water, so he requested  that  his servants
proceed to dry it.  Then he began  to try to eat  the bodies  of the  ten lions.
It was only then  he realized  that these were in fact ten lions  made of stone.
Try to explain the riddle.
