It is a bleak Day.  Hear the Rain,  how he pours,  and the Hail, how he rattles;
and see the Snow, how he drifts along,  and oh the Mud,  how deep he is!  Ah the
poor  Fishwife,  it is  stuck fast  in the Mire;  it has  dropped  its Basket of
Fishes;  and its Hands  have been cut  by the  Scales as  it seized  some of the
falling Creatures;  and one Scale  has even got into its Eye.  And it cannot get
her out.  It opens its Mouth to cry for Help; but if any Sound comes out of him,
alas he is drowned by the raging of the Storm.
